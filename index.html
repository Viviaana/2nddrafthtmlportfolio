        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>As far back as I can remember I've been obsessed with computers, growing up with technology moving at a blinding pace you had to keep up. I was always the kid hogging the SNES, even just getting to play the point-and-click story games at school was exciting for me.</p>
        <p>Usually I can be found fitting in crocheting whilst waiting for queues in games, but it's not all indoors. I'm also an axe thrower as part of a league, competing in local tournaments

        <h3>My Journey with Code Nation</h3>
        <p>When I was offered a chance to come learn with CodeNation I was thrilled to get a chance to start a new career in a field I’d actually find interesting. 
        I've spent many years in my various jobs trying to get more involved with tech, spending a lot of time with the IT department to get a better understanding of how everything worked.
        There’s no greater feeling than trying something new and actually understanding it, even a rudimentary text based adventure game seemed so exciting because it was my code powering it. </p>
        <p>I’ve absolutely loved stepping out of my comfort zone and throwing myself into a new challenge and it’s been such a huge boost to my confidence. It's really helped motivate me to keep working towards my goal and furthering my career, this is something I can really be proud of and invest myself into.
